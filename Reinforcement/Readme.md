Goal: Try to scale/cut/monitor budget across various platforms so that your ROI is maximized across all platform


1. how frequently you create/change budget across all platforms?
2. where are you getting the information of all these campaigns perfromacnce?
3. where are getting data of impressions, clicks, spend, ROI etc
4. how campaigns are created across all platforms( with same kind of moto ) as you are shifting money from one platform to other platform( are you doing between campaings or as a overall )?
5. how are you scaling up or down the Spend across various platforms
6. can we use reinforcement learning?
7. Reinforcment learning: It is all about you performa an action to see if you got a reward/punishment and learn to perform better in future state to maximize the rewards and reduce punishments

Reinforcement Learning:

how many types of actions can you perform from the given inputs - various combinations
which action if I perform will maximize my ROI
